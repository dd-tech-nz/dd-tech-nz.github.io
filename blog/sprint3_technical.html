                                    <h1 align="center">Difference Between HTML and CSS</h1>
                                    <p><strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</strong> is a language used to create documents on the web. HTML is meant for meaning and structure of a web pages's content.</p>
                                    <p>HTML contains tags that organize the structure text and include images, links to other web pages as well as forms and tables.</p>
                                    <p>A website built purely with HTML would be rather bland and basic containing mostly just unformatted text.</p>
                                    <p><strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)</strong> is another language used to create documents on the web. CSS is meant for the presentation of a web page's content.</p>
                                    <p>CSS is used to modify any HTML tags so as to deliver a branded experience by allowing us to specify the style, formatting and presentation of the HTML elements.</p>
                                    <p>A metaphor of CSS and HTML would be that of a store. </p>
                                    <dl>
                                        <dt><strong>HTML</strong></dt>
                                        <dd>Floorplan</dd>
                                        <dd>Shelves and counters</dd>
                                        <dd>Products for sale</dd>
                                        <dt><strong>CSS</strong></dt>
                                        <dd>Layout of shelves and counters</dd>
                                        <dd>Arrangement of products for sale</dd>
                                        <dd>Paint and decoration of the store</dd>
                                      </dl>
                                    <p>A third component of many websites is <strong>JavaScript</strong> which would equate to the employees that operate the store enabling you to walk in and and make your purchases.</p>
                                    <h1 align="center">Control flow and loops, arrays and objects</h1>
                                    <p>Using an example from everyday life of using my Slack messenger application I will illustrate how the the control flow works in programming.</p>
                                    
                                    <div class="image is-square">
                                        <img src="img/flowchart.jpg" alt="slack flowchart">
                                      </div>
                                      <br>
                                      <p>An array is a Data Type that holds multiple values, which can be numbers, strings or other nested arrays</p>
                                    <p>Array's items can be accessed using a sequential index and arrays are mutable, it is a data type that can be changed using methods of the programming language.</p>
                                    <p>An object is similar to an array in that it can contain multiple different data types including nested arrays and other nested objects. The items within an object are not accessed sequentially as in an array but rather through the use of a key value pair. Each value within the object is assigned a key and can be referenced by that key.</p>
                                      <h1 align="center">DOM - Document Object Model</h1>
                                      <p>The web browser parses the website as a document object with elements which follow a parent/child/sibling hierarchy similar to that of a family tree. </p>
                                      <div class="image is-3by2">
                                        <img src="img/DOM.jpg" alt="DOM tree structure">
                                      </div>
                                      <p>Using the DOM we are able to select HTML elements using CSS to add style to the content of the webpage by changing their properties and attributes.</p>
                                      <p>Most importantly the DOM enables us to create dynamic HTML using JavaScript. JavaScript can change, add and remove all HTML elements and their attributes as well as all the CSS styling associated with the elements.</p>
                                      <p>On top of that JavaScript is able to trigger code in response to existing events in the DOM as well as create new events in the DOM.</p>
                                      <h1 align="center">Functions</h1>
                                      <p>A function is code that is compiled before being called. A function can simply execute an action or it can execute an action and return a value.</p>
                                      <p>The advantage of functions is that they enable us to use code over and over again in our program simply by calling the function using a statement with the function name.</p>
                                      <p>The function can take input parameters, called arguments, in the code to calculate and return a value.</p>
