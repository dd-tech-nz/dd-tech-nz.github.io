        <h3 align="center">Three New Things I Learned About Myself and My Ego as a Result of Core Learning</h3>

        <p>
            When I enrolled at Dev Academy, I had the aspiration of becoming a coding ninja and was surprised at the amount of material and time dedicated to learning core skills centred around personal introspection. In the past I would rush into a challenge head first and then get severely jaded when things don’t go to plan often finding a solution to what I tried to accomplish by coding along to a YouTube tutorial. However, I have learned that it is impossible to know everything there is to coding and become a walking “JavaScript Wikipedia’. Rather the skill comes down to being able to effectively locate information and resources that are important to the tasks I am trying to accomplish. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also learned that it is much more important to understand the process of how the data flows in the algorithms rather than just learning the language semantics of functions. Understanding the logic, I believe will enable me to transfer my skill to other programming languages, not just JavaScript, where the semantics of the language may be different but the overall structure of functions and variables similar.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most importantly I have learned to start small and break problems down into byte-size chunks and test my data flow using the browser’s built-in dev tools. In this way I feel I am able to work more methodically with a clear mindset. The daily habits of asking myself of what my daily goals are and the challenges I am going to face has proven invaluable in my time so far at Dev Academy.
        </p>
        <h3 align="center">Role of Values, Empathy and Self Awareness in Learning Programming</h3>
        <p>
            Values are important because values are the inner-voice that is driving us when things become tough and we run into blocks. My values and the reasons behind being a programmer is what drives me when I feel frustrated and overwhelmed. I also believe it is also important to understand the values of the company and the customer that I will be working for because it will give me an insight into what is important to that individual or company and the feel and layout of their website or online app that they want as well as an insight into their customer base.
        </p>
        <p>
            Empathy and self-awareness are other key factors because it is important to understand my interaction with the customer and my peers. As far as the customer is concerned the issues of global warming, coronavirus and skirmishes along the Syria-Turkey border are trivial matters when it comes their own business where the the form fields of an online application are not displaying correctly. Being able to step outside myself and identify when I am feeling frustrated, angry, overwhelmed or just plain bored is also important and is a skill and virtue. The handle of ‘angry’ or ‘frustrated’ is too simple to describe me as an individual and when I do encounter negative emotions such as these, I should understand that I am running through my rituals of anger or frustration. Being aware of this will give me the ability to shift my focus and change my breathing and physiology to get into a more optimal state.
        </p>
        <h3 align="center">What Suprised Me Most About Core Learning</h3>
        <p>
            I am surprised at how quickly my brain rewires itself when I practice the competencies on a daily basis and how easily I am able to pick up knowledge and skills in a flipped classroom setting. I have been very much an autodidact in developing my technology skills, but have not experienced such a steep learning curve as at Dev Academy which I think comes from the habits that I instilled since enrolling on the course that trigger a flow state and having developed a better level of self-awareness.
        </p>
        <h3 align="center">Most Challenging Aspects About Core Learning</h3>
        <p>
            I found the most challenging part of core learning was writing down and documenting everything I learned because I had to think and evaluate how my mind and brain works and also finding the time to write and publish my blogs,  often at times when my brain is locked on completing a coding assignment.
        </p>
        <h3 align="center">Why so Much Time is Spent Focussed on Core Learning?</h3>
        <p>
            What has surprised me the most about core learning is the amount of resource committed to these skills on a coding course. However, in retrospect it all makes sense because the course is not simply a case of cramming knowledge, but in becoming the sort of person who is able to learn and work efficiently. I believe in this day and age where technology moves and changes rapidly the skill of being able to learn effectively is the most important skill.
        </p>
        <h3 align="center">Would the Time Spent Studying Core Learning be Better Used Practicing Programming?</h3>
        <p>
            I do not think the time spent studying core learning was wasted time which could have been better spent practicing programming. I think it is important to approach a coding assignment with the correct frame of mind. I find time flies when I start coding and at times I get locked into tunnel vision and waste time googling and searching for a quick answer for a piece of code I am writing which would be better spent if just took a step back, cleared my head of the frustration, and break down and re-evaluated what my code is trying to accomplish and approach the problem with a better frame of mind.

      <h1 align="center">Reflection on Learning</h1>
      <h3 align="center">Long Term Goals</h3>
      <p>
        My long-term goal is to develop the competency to be able to build full stack applications. Ideally, I would like to work as a free-lancer which would give me the freedom to work anywhere in the world. However, I will probably need to first get experience working for a company as a full-stack developer to get more in-depth experience of the trade.
      </p>
      <h3 align="center">Strengths and Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        My strength is that my number one value, the driving force in my life is success. I am prepared to do whatever it takes to successfully complete the course and to be working as a full-stack developer in the next few months. Nothing has really changed since I started the course five weeks ago apart from the fact that I have gained more momentum and confidence in seeing my coding assignments to completion in the stipulated time-frame. I am going into bootcamp with an open mind and a desire to do whatever it takes to walk away with the skills to land me a job as a full-stack developer.
      </p>
      <h3 align="center">Biggest Non-Technical Challenge</h3>
      <p>
        My biggest non-technical challenge at bootcamp will be just showing up each day in a flow state. During foundation I am used to waking up in the early hours of the morning to work on a coding assignment and then napping late morning or even afternoon and working on my own terms whereas I imagine bootcamp will be a time where I will have to be fully focussed throughout the 8:30 – 5:30 work day. Because of the steep learning curve, it will be much harder than coming into work.
      </p>
      <h3 align="center">Non-Technical Skills I Would Like to Develop</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to see myself develop leadership and communication skills at EDA. To get first-hand experience of being able to leverage agile methodology and to be able to take charge of any upcoming projects.
      </p>
      <h3 align="center">My Expectations of Myself at Bootcamp</h3>
      <p>
        My expectation of myself at Bootcamp would be to give it one hundred percent for the full nine weeks. Based on my knowledge, Dougal Stott would be the person to speak to regarding any issues I may come across regarding the management of my time and resources on the course. I will approach the course with an open mind with an avid desire to be a professional full-stack developer at any cost. Having said that I will ensure to keep a balance and run my martial arts classes twice a week and go to the gym. With regards to my interactions with facilitators and members of my cohort I will observe and listen intently because we can all learn from each other. Most importantly I will do my utmost to contribute to this programme in all ways.
