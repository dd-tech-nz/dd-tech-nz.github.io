		<p>My long-term goals as a web developer is to work as a free-lancer and create financial freedom for myself on my own terms. My short-term goals are to be proficient in leveraging the power of JavaScript in front and back-end develpment of web apps.</p>
		<e>The non-technical skills that I would like to see developed during my time at EDA would be <strong>marketing</strong> skills to attract customers, <strong>business negotiation</strong> skills, evaluation of how much I should be charging my customers for projects and also skills in <strong>job seeking</strong> and <strong>interview</strong> skills. In addition, I would also like to know how to create an <strong>attractive portfolio</strong>.</p>
		<p>I believe my core strength is my technology background. IT can be an intimidating field and a web developer, particularly a freelancer, needs to be savvy not just in coding but in areas of technology such as DNS, cloud technology and virtualization. The web developer I believe also should understand the fundamentals of IP networking and security as well as hosting server technologies such as IIS and Apache.</p>
		<p>My current limitations are my technical knowledge of backend database technologies such as SQL and MongoDB. I am hoping I will a working knowledge of these back-end technologies by the time I complete my study course at EDA. I have quite limited exposure to JavaScript also which will no longer be the case once I have completed this course. </p>
        <p>I manage my workload by diligently allocating my time resources throughout the day to my tasks, challenges and projects. I have a tendency to get up early. Since starting the course, 5am is quite a normal wake up time for me. I guess I am just excited about taking my IT career in this new direction and am a sponge for learning and developing my skills in this area. I find the early hours of the morning to be a tranquil time for me to gather my thoughts, meditate and plan my day. By the time I have had breakfast and walked my dog I would have already spent 2-3 hours working through the course material; which is a big bonus in managing my daily time. Currently this is what my typical day looks like:</p>

        <p>So far, I have been working completely on my own with just one weekly catchup session with Joseph, my facilitator. However, I am very open to collaboration, sharing of knowledge and helping others. I have not had to reach out via the #code-help-desk Slack channel or ask any of my foundation peers of facilitator for help with any of my challenges or projects. That’s not to say its not going to happen in the near future. Its just I find what I need to know much quicker on Google and Stack Overflow. However, there may be a much greater need for brainstorming and collaboration in later projects and challenges.So far I have had good confidence in my ability to complete all of the tasks at hand.</p>

        <p>I expect my facilitator to be available to me if I run into any problems on the course and be there to provide me with a clear set of goals, progress and clear feedback.</p>

        <p>As a martial arts instructor I do have two weekly commitments to run my classes in the evenings and I have made plans to postpone the earlier set classes for the duration of my bootcamp however I am able to still run the earier classes whilst I am on the foundation course.</p>
