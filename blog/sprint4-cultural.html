        <p>
            Thinking an action and performing an action require the same motor sensory processes in the brain. Mentally going through the motions of performing a physical movement strengthens the neurons responsible for the movement instruction and enhances the strength and power of the movement even in the absence of physical exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
            The analogy of the neural pathways in the brain can be likened to a state highway. The more cars that travel along the road, the wider the highway has to get. The groups if neurons in the brain that fire together will shape themselves accordingly to an activity or memory will get stronger and more robust the more they are engaged. Likewise, when people stop practicing an activity, the neural pathways associated with those activities will also diminish. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding neuroplasticity enables people to learn to facilitate the learning of skills such as playing a musical instrument or to recover from injury and has far reaching implications from medicine to education.
        </p>
        <p>
            My aphorism is “repetition is the mother of skill”. I believe it is important to code every day, to engage the thinking process of working with JavaScript. This is the main reason I enrolled in Dev Academy because I believe that coding every day for 16 weeks will enable me to develop the skills and the mindset required for the industry. In the past and dabbled in JavaScript, having enrolled in online courses such as free Code Camp, but already half way through my fourth week of foundation am finding that I am surpassing the level of learning and understanding that I gained from months of intermittent study sessions from online courses.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ways I can increase my neuroplasticity is by writing code and solving coding challenges every day, engaging with people who also code and learn from each other’s experience, keeping a technical blog where I can reflect on how I came up with a coding solution. Most importantly I should view exercising my brain in the same way as exercising my body and practice daily gratitude, mindfulness, surround myself with a peer-group who share my values and hold me to a high standard, drink plenty of fluid and eat healthy and follow a daily exercise regimen.

        <h1 align="center">Growth Mindset</h1>
        <p>
            Growth Mindset is a mindset that does not eschew problems and rather than seeing a barrier sees the problem as something that is not perfect yet. Conversely a fixed mindset avoids challenges and problems and believes that talent, intelligence and ability are something you are simply born with. Often people use this as an excuse to justify why they can’t do something; they would see someone achieve something and say ‘He/she is just gifted and was just born with a talent’.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the context of IT, I often experience the growth mindset. When a customer has a problem, they see it as a barrier whereas I would look at the error message, check the system logs and configuration and engage with the problem, learn from it and correct it.
        </p>
        <p>
            I believe you cannot succeed on this course or as a coder if you do not have a growth mindset. On this course I am constantly being pushed out of my comfort zone as the level of challenges increases with each sprint and I find myself researching and learning something new. Just like the muscles at the gym need resistance to grow, the difficulty in solving a coding challenge enables my mind to grow the neurons in the brain as they make new connections with the effort of completing the challenges. This ties in nicely with the above article on neuroplasticity.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will integrate growth mindset into my learning journey by applying the problem-solving processes discussed in my tech blog to systematically approach each problem and challenge and to document, reflect and learn from it. My life aphorism is “you are either growing or dying”; I always aim to look for the next level and believe that true fulfilment can only be found in growth. This can only be achieved by facing challenges, tackling problems and taking myself outside of my comfort zone.
