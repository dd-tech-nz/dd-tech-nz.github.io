		<p>My number one value is success. To be successful I believe we should look at other people and see how we are able to contribute to others. My interest in web development fledged whilst I was working as an IT consultant. I was working for a startup firm that had no website which motivated me to learn HTML and CSS in my spare time. &nbsp;I started practicing examples on w3chool.com and built a rather crude landing page which was my first foray into web development. However, by the time I knew what I was doing, the boss of the firm had already hired a professional web developer for the job.</p>
		<p>I was building Windows servers and setting up infrastructure for small businesses, migrating them onto Office 365 and providing BAU technical support. Fortunately for me, the small business whose IT infrastructure I setup at the time had their website hacked. It was a meat distribution business who had no website and no online contact form for customers to reach them. Using my new skills, I built a website for them in my spare time, at the time using the Bootstrap 3 framework, which I then converted to a WordPress template so the business could autonomously administer their own content. This endeared me to the business and four years later I am still privately managing and maintaining their IT infrastructure and web presence. Here is the website I built&nbsp;

		</p>
		<p>Sinking my teeth into web development, I have also built a free website for a security company which I later had to take down because the boss would not pay me the hosting fees. I guess he must have taken my kindness in building and hosting the website free for a year for him as weakness. I have also created my own personal website and blog using bootstrap and WordPress. The site is&nbsp;

		</p>
		<p>My second value is health. I am a Taekwondo black belt and martial arts instructor. Some tell me that my interests are world apart but I disagree. I believe both martial arts and technology are art forms; they deal with effectiveness, aesthetics and user experience. I am excited about pursuing a career in web development because I believe it will give me more flexibility with my work in being able to work more on my own terms, which I guess like martial arts also requires a higher level of discipline and commitment.</p>
        <p>My third value is love, which comes in the form of helping others and also my Rottweiler bitch. My dog is much more than just a pet to me, she is my companion dog that I have trained since she was a puppy. I don’t think I will ever get the same loyalty, unconditional love and companionship that I get from my dog anywhere else. I cannot describe how much I love my dog. Hopefully one day I can look forward to being a parent and raising some human kids, but for now my dog is my fur-kid.</p>
        <p>At the end of last year I published a book on Amazon when I had a little bit of spare time having completed a two year contract working for ANZ Bank. Here is an except from my book which I believe decribes my values and my outlook.</p>

        <div class="content is-large notification">
            <p><em>"Wealth is not simply money; wealth is leverage; it is the ability to have the experience in life that you have not controlled or generated. I could say that I’ll wire a million dollars into your bank account if you send me your details, and invariably, there will be those who would come up with an excuse why they can’t find their bank details. It sounds like an exaggeration, but one million dollars is nothing. The advice that is readily available all over the Internet for free is worth much more than a million dollars if you apply it. I started up an IT consultancy business setting up server infrastructure, building and migrating servers on the information I obtained from reading blogs from Microsoft TechNet, from watching YouTube videos, knowledge for which companies paid me thousands of dollars. I built my first commercial website from following instructions and studying an online web development course that I downloaded for free."</em></p>
