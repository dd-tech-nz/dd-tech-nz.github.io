		<h1 align="center">Three Steps of Emotional Intelligence</h1>
<h2>1 - Attention Training</h2>
<p>Emotional Intelligence is about self-awareness of our emotions and the rituals that we go through when we experience these emotions in terms of how we use our bodies and physiology, what we focus on and our own internal dialogue.</p>
<h2>2 -&nbsp;Self-Knowledge and Self-Mastery</h2>
<p>When challenges come up and we experience negative emotions the aim is not to judge ourselves or be in denial of these states but rather passively observe what is happening in our minds, what we focus on, how we breathe and how we use our bodies during that time.</p>
<p>Rather than saying I am angry, or I am depressed I could say that I am running through my angry or depression ritual. This self-awareness enables us to identify these rituals and gives us the power to interrupt them and gain a better mastery of our emotional states. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Naturally we do more to avoid pain than to gain pleasure but we can leverage this mastery to also home in on the positive emotions such as excitement, motivation and creativity by identifying how we use our bodies, what we focus on and our internal dialogue in these states so that we can trigger them at will.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>3 - Creating Useful Mental Habits</h2>
<p>By creating mental habits, we can literally anchor certain states into our daily routine. For example, when I wake up, I feed my fish, take a large glass of water with some apple cider vinegar and sit down and plan my goals and challenges for the day whilst I hydrate myself, first thing in the morning. This has become my daily habit since I started the course at EDA.</p>
<h1>Importance of Emotional Intelligence</h1>
<p>There are countless examples of successful people who have created a successful career for themselves; who had every reason to be happy with their lives; who were loved and respected by many but ended up in an early grave due to suicide or drug overdose. Their tragedy comes down to one main reason – they were unable to manage their mental state.</p>
<p>By managing our mental state we are able to take decisive action towards our goals by understanding what it is that we focus on and how we use our physiology when we are in a triggered state and likewise understand what is happening in our minds and bodies when we run up against a block and are feeling frustrated, overwhelmed or beginning to procrastinate.</p>
<h1>Looping Exercise</h1>
<p>Feeling of connection and also the feeling of being significant are two conflicting personality needs that each of us shares. The experience of sharing with a colleague a challenge on the course that triggered us and which we overcame satisfied the significance need of the personality whilst having someone listen and relate to what was being said satisfied the connection need of the personality. The exercise enabled me to identify the two needs in the context of the challenges that we experience at EDA.</p>
<h1>Mediation</h1>
<p>This week I installed the Headspace app and each morning on waking I took 5 minutes to meditate and passively observe my thoughts early in the morning whilst paying attention to my breathing and my body. The practice has helped me clear my thoughts so I am not caught up a weird headspace like I sometimes can get when getting up in the mornings and the quiet breathing and attention made me feel energized whilst at the same time feeling calm and relaxed.</p>
